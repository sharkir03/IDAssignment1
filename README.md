## Technologies Used

- [Font Awesome](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** to create social media buttons.
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.gstatic.com, https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Josefin+Sans&display=swap, https://fonts.gstatic.com, https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Encode+Sans:wght@500&display=swap)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** to create fonts for the header, buttons, and footer.

## Testing
1. Website Navigation:
    1. Go to the "Introduction" page
    2. Click "Education & Works" button.
    3. Go to "Education & Works" page.
    4. Click "Personal Works" button.
    5. Go to "Personal Works" page.

- Realised that I didn't cater to when the browser has bookmarks tab open. Issue fixed, I hope. Font size looks really small on a phone screen but if I make it bigger it seems to be very badly arranged. 

- I have not discovered any bugs so far. Unless I missed them, because I don't really know how to spot any.
