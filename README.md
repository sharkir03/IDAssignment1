## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Technologies Used

- [Font Awesome](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** to create social media buttons.
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.gstatic.com, https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Josefin+Sans&display=swap, https://fonts.gstatic.com, https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Encode+Sans:wght@500&display=swap)

## Testing
1. Website Navigation:
    1. Go to the "Introduction" page
    2. Click "Education & Works" button.
    3. Go to "Education & Works" page.
    4. Click "Personal Works" button.
    5. Go to "Personal Works" page.

- Realised that I didn't cater to when the browser has bookmarks tab open. Issue fixed, I hope. Font size looks really small on a phone screen but if I make it bigger it seems to be very badly arranged. 

- I have not discovered any bugs so far. Unless I missed them, because I don't really know how to spot any.
